Energy Investment Center. The center’s mission is to advance private,
mission-oriented investment in clean energy technologies that address
the present gap in U.S. clean tech investment. It will also enhance
the availability of the Department’s resources to investors and the
public.</p><p>Financing and partnerships are crucial components for the acceleration
and success this initiative, and that is why we welcome the addition
of any interested collaborators. Specifically, mission-driven
investors— such as foundations, university endowments, and
institutional investors— can play an important role in providing an
additional source of capital for the transition to a low-carbon
economy.</p><h2>CEIC Offerings</h2><ul><li><h3>Single Point of Access for Information</h3><p>The center will ensure information about DOE programs is more
understandable and accessible. It will also serve as a one-stop
for the investors to locate subject matter experts, acquire the
latest reports and data on clean energy technology, and find a
listing of companies and projects funded by the agency. This
information will enable investors to make informed decisions that
is based on DOE’s research and analysis.</p><h3>Technical Assistance</h3><p>The center will share research and analysis produced by DOE and
its 17 national laboratories on relevant developments in clean
energy technology. Furthermore, the center will offer a mechanism
for identifying the need for new technology analysis from DOE.</p><h3>Information on Early-Stage Projects and Companies</h3><p>DOE currently has programs including the Advanced Research
Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E), Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR), Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR), and
others that help to fund and accelerate emerging early-stage
technology projects and companies. The center will aggregate and
make available public information on entities currently engaged in
partnerships with DOE.</p><h3>Connections to Additional Relevant U.S. Government Programs</h3><p>The center will include information about energy and climate
programs at other government agencies including the U.S.
Department of Agriculture, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development, U.S. Department of Transportation, U.S. Department of
