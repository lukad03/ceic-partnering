## Documentation

the Presidential Innovation Fellows.

To get started, run `npm-install` to install dependencies and then `grunt` to
start the server locally.

## Form Data
This repo does not contain the custom configuration needed to send data
to Nutshell or any other CMS. It does however contain the WooFoo form submission endpoints located in each of the `.jade` files located in `src/forms`. Once
youâ€™ve configured your own WooFoo account or similar service, you can change
these endpoints to submit to your account.
